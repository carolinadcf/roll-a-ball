# Roll a ball

This is an extended version of the Unity Roll a Ball tutorial for Interactive Systems UPF course.

In the "Build 2" folder you will find the Release executable. This project includes as an extra of the tutorial:

  - Sounds (background tictac + win sound + defeat sound)
  - A skybox (cubemap)
  - New 3D objects (clock hands) as obstacles
  - Textures (ground clock + ball as gear assembly)
  - New materials (skybox, clock hands, ball, ground...)
  - 15 second timer so the game has two possible outcomes:
    - Victory: if the player pick's up the 12 boxes before the time ends
    - Defeat: if the user runs out of time before they pick up all the collectibles
